# 🧠 ML-Models

A comprehensive collection of machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and deep learning models built from scratch or with useful tools for educational purposes and knowledge reinforcement.

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository serves as my learning laboratory where I:

- Build ML algorithms from scratch to understand the underlying mathematics
- Practice and reinforce core ML/NN/LLM concepts
- Experiment with different implementations and approaches
- Document my learning journey in machine learning and deep learning


## 📚 Current Implementations
### 🔢 Regression Models

Linear & Polynomial Regression. Built from scratch using NumPy
<br>

Implements gradient descent optimization and includes visualization and performance metrics

## 🤝 Contributing
This is primarily a personal learning repository, but if you'd like to:

- Suggest improvements to existing implementations
- Point out bugs or mathematical errors
- Recommend additional algorithms to implement

Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request!
